# The Boxcode Programming Language

Welcome to the **BoxCode** project! This project aimed to create a simple programming language using Python. The project includes a lexer, parser, and interpreter for the language.

## Introduction
This project was a personal challenge to create a language from scratch using Python. It covers the essential components of a programming language, including lexical analysis, parsing, and interpretation.

## Features
- Simple syntax and structure
- Lexer to tokenize the input code
- Parser to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Interpreter to execute the parsed
